Small businesses and internal IT departments often struggle to manage incoming requests via
email alone. They need a centralized dashboard to record, prioritize, and track the status of
support tickets to ensure no issue goes unresolved.
1. Core Functional Requirements
• Create Ticket: Users must be able to add a ticket with a Subject, Description, Category
(Technical, Billing, General), and Priority (Low, Medium, High).
• Input Validation: Prevent empty subjects and ensure a category/priority is selected before
saving.
• Ticket List: Display tickets in a structured view (Table or Grid). Each entry must show the
Subject, Priority (with color coding), Status, and Date Created.
• Status Tracking: Every ticket defaults to "Open". Users must be able to toggle status between
"Open", "In Progress", and "Resolved".
• Edit & Delete: Users can modify ticket details or remove a ticket (requires a confirmation
pop-up).
• User Authentication: Implement a secure Sign-up and Login system.
• Session Management: Users must stay logged in after a page refresh, and unauthorized
users should be redirected to the login page

2. Summary & UI Requirements
• Statistics Header: Display the total number of Open, In Progress, and Resolved tickets at the
top of the dashboard.
• Priority Indicators: Use visual cues (e.g., Red for High, Yellow for Medium, Green for Low) to
differentiate ticket urgency.
• Overdue Warning: If a ticket is "Open" and older than a specific timeframe (e.g., 24 hours), it
must be visually flagged with an icon or warning color.

3. Non-Functional & Technical Requirements
• Persistence: All user accounts and ticket data must be stored in a persistent database (e.g.,
SQLite, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL). Browser refreshes or server restarts must not result in data
loss.
• API Design: Use standard RESTful or GraphQL patterns for communication between the
frontend and backend.
• Stability: The app must handle database connection errors or empty result sets gracefully.
• Data Persistence: All expense and budget data must be stored in a local SQLite database.
• Performance: UI updates should reflect the state of the database immediately.
4. Bonus Features (Optional)
• Search/Filter: Filter tickets by priority or search by keyword.
• Dark Mode: Support for theme switching.
• Export: Download ticket logs as CSV or PDF.
